interpret(slice, vdev_name, style, vdev_command_str)
- convert vdev_command_str to p4command
- get list of hp4 commands from interpreting p4command
  - hp4commands = vdev.interpret(p4command)
- is vdev on a physical device?
  - no:
    - synthesize staged handle for each hp4 command
    - track the (table, synth_handle): rule for each hp4 command
      - vdev.hp4rules[(table, hp4handle)] = rule
  - yes:
    - verify lease has capacity to accept list of hp4 commands
    - push each hp4 command to phys device and collect handle
    - track the (table, handle): rule for each hp4 command, update lease capacity
      - vdev.hp4rules[(table, hp4handle)] = rule
      - vdev.hp4_code_and_rules[(table, hp4handle)] = rule
- update native ruleset
