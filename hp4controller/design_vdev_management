Task: Enable vdev management while not part of a vdev chain

interpret process:
- client: interpret <vdev name> <rule style> <command>
- Controller::handle_request
- Slice::handle_request
- Slice::interpret
  - VirtualDevice::interpret
  - Accounting - check whether space is available to push rules
  - Push rules

This is good news - all we have to do is split the 'interpret' method after line 394:

  hp4commands = vdev.interpret(p4command)

Currently, the client's 'interpret' command assumes the intent is to push the resulting rules to the physical device associated with the virtual device.  We should define the following semantics:
  - default:
    if vdev has a device:
      if device has sufficient space:
        push rules to the device
      else:
        discard
    else:
      discard
  - --stage:
    interpret command but do not push result; hold w/out handle (use staging area handle)
  - --stage_if_full:
    interpret and push if possible; else hold

vdev management
  - vdev_stage_flush:
    push all staged rules
    vdev_stage_clear:
    drop all staged rules
