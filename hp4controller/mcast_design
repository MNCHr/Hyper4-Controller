Multicast group creation / management

Fastest:
- Support only broadcasting to all ports on the lease.  Assume that, for bmv2 devices, setting im.mcast_grp is with intent to broadcast.

Tasks:
- Compiler: need to leave token [MCAST_GRP] in for any modify_field on im.mcast_grp that is replaced when loaded onto device w/ lease's mcast_grp id for broadcasting

- Lease creation:
  - Query device for mcast_grp ID
  - Send mcast_grp, mcast_node create/assignment commands to device

- Virtual Device Load
  - replace [MCAST_GRP] with lease's mcast_grp_id

- Fix: at creation of RuntimeAPI, not passing mc_client, resulting in error
  __init__(self, pre_type, standard_client, mc_client=None):
