sorted_branches:
  reconstructs pcs.parse_state.return_statement[PS_RET_BRANCHES]
  with all criteria in order

revised_branches:
  revision of sorted_branches: all values fit parse_select table boundaries

TODO:
- sort_branches should also sort the pcs.select_criteria and return it, or else
  we can do this after sort_branches via sorted_indices
- setup_select_revision obsolete?
- fix revise_branches from line 251+
