p4_hp4 questions / concerns:
- Why are the ps_to_pc values each a set of a list of one element?  Can't we simply have an int like the keys in pc_to_ps?
- parse_select_match_offsets is never read
  - written to in process_parse_state
- pc_bits_extracted - why w/ test_select do we have pc_state 1 with 368 bits extracted?
- shouldn't we be calling process_parse_state starting with the root of the parse tree?  test_select seems to start from a leaf node, not the 'start' parser function

pc_bits_extracted is written to in:
- (1) process_parse_state
- (2) walk_parse_tree
- (3) gen_tset_parse_control_entries

gen_tset_parse_control_entries calls
  walk_parse_tree which calls
    process_parse_state

but modifications to pc_bits_extracted happen in reverse order (or,
in the order listed above) due to the
ordering of other instructions within each function

Belief is that pc_bits_extracted should represent the guarantee re:
the number of bits that must have been extracted from the packet
prior to entering the pc_state, but in terms of HP4 operation,
it represents the number of bits that will have been extracted
by the end of the associated parse state

DO:
- analyze and fix process_parse_state - pretty sure it is
  incorrectly handling current statements
  - esp.: understand what parse_select_pc_state represents
    vs. pc_state
