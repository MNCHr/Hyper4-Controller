create_virtual_device -> hp4loader.load -> what was previously done in controller2.py::Controller::link 

Question: Should we, avoid specifying the physical ports at time of virtual device creation?

We should.  If we can't, we should.  We need to look at hp4l to see how physical port mappings are handled.  We may need to defer some of the work that happens in hp4l until composition placement time.

We should.  Examination of hp4l and p4c-hp4.py suggests that the --phys_ports option (and the code using it) is obsolete.  It does not appear that p4c-hp4.py ever produces [PPORT #] tokens.

Therefore when looking at controller2.py::Controller::link code, don't call hp4l with the --phys_ports option.
