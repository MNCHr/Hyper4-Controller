Approaches to debugging VIBRANT-CloudLab:

Mininet experiment t09 works (except that xterms no longer automatically launch traffic generating scripts as before - fix is to edit run_t09.sh to send the commands via ttyecho as we do in run_t10_cl.sh).

Collect increasingly detailed symptoms until we spot the problem.

Current status: Packets flow until the encryptors are installed.  There are no evident errors thrown by encryptor installation.
We have figured out how to use tee with python: python -u forces unbuffered output so that tee will show it on stdout while writing to a file at the same time.  Let's run the experiment and see whether there are any errors during encryptor vdev installation.
