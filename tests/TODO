TASKS:

- Test: t05
Goal: produce evaluation of service chains
- see t05; chain evolution:
  TOPOLOGY:
  2 switches
  6 hosts
  s1 s2
  h1 s1
  h2 s1
  h3 s1
  h4 s2
  h5 s2
  h6 s2
  SLICE 1: h1, h2, h4, h5
  Functionality mirrored on s1, s2
  - switch
  - switch -> router
  - switch
  - switch -> arp proxy
  - arp proxy
  - arp proxy -> switch
  - arp proxy -> switch -> router
  - arp proxy -> switch -> router -> firewall
  - arp proxy -> switch -> firewall
  - switch -> firewall
  - firewall
  SLICE 2: h3, h6
  Functionality mirrored on s1, s2
  - switch
- show no packets dropped as we make changes to the chain (except when they should be)
- show bandwidth impact, single slice
- show latency impact, single slice
- show bandwidth impact, neighbor slice
- show latency impact, single slice

- Test each client function

- [DONE] Test dropless version of t06 (configure fw before inserting into the chain)
