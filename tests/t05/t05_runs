T05

Run 1:
- After creating/provisioning jupiter slice and starting xterms for all hosts:

    [h1 xterm:] echo 3; sleep 1; echo 2; sleep 1; echo 1; sleep 1; ping -f 10.1.0.102
    [test window:] at the end of h1's countdown, hit a key

Run 2:
- Same as previous, but this time, after 'update topology', add:

    [h3 xterm:] ping -f 10.2.0.106

Run 3:
- Same as previous, except instead of ping -f, we do this:

    [h1 xterm:] echo 3; sleep 1; echo 2; sleep 1; echo 1; sleep 1; iperf -c 10.1.0.102
    [test window:]

Run 4:
- Same as previous, but this time, after 'update topology', add:

    [h3 xterm:] ping -f 10.2.0.106

Runs 5, 6: do like runs 2 and 4 but on the saturn slice set up l2 switch and do iperf (5) and ping -f (6); make sure to tcpdump on correct interface
