T05

Run 1:
- After creating/provisioning jupiter slice and starting xterms:

    [h1 xterm]# h1ping.sh
    [test window]$ <at the end of h1's countdown, hit a key>

Run 2:
- Same as previous, but this time, after jupiter and xterms are ready:

    [h6 xterm]# iperf -s -i 1
    [h3 xterm]# iperf -c 10.2.0.106 BUT DO NOT HIT ENTER YET
    
- After 'update topology', wait for countdown to hit enter in h3 xterm

Run 3:
- Same as Run 1, except instead of h1ping.sh, we do this:

    [h1 xterm]# h1iperf.sh
    [test window]$ <at the end of h1's countdown, hit a key>

Run 4:
- Same as Run 2, but h1iperf.sh instead of h1ping.sh

Runs 5, 6: do like runs 2 and 4 but on the saturn slice set up l2 switch and do iperf (5) and ping -f (6); make sure to tcpdump on correct interface
